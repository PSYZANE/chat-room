# chat-room
- well a simple chat room😉
- finally a semi-finished project😁
- only remaining is the 'date and time storage problem (when you rejoin it shows the old chat but with the wrong date/time i.e., the joining time for the old chat )
- and UI/UX
- 🤷‍♂️ I just can't do an ultra-amazing front-end
